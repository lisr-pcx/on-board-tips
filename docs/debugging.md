# Debugging

Developers spend a considerable amount of time looking what's going wrong on running code. Learn where to look and how to do it is a basic skill of the job.

A **software bug** is a defect in the logic, correctness, or performance of a software system.

+ The program compile but it does not do at runtime what the developer expects *(logic)*
+ The program executes the right path but produces the wrong result *(correctness)*
+ When dependent on workload or external system/architecture *(performance)*
+ When occur in concurrent code and are sporadically observable *(non deterministic)*

Debugging is closely related to testing. *Testing* means we are checking for the presence of a bug, *debugging* is the process of removing an observed fault in software, and both are essential skills to learn.

## Strategies

Work experience and practice will improve your skills, but in the meantime apply any kind of tricks usefull for your scenario.

### (1) Scan and Look

Have a look and follow intuition (senior developers get best result compared to junior)

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(){
    int PI = 3.1415;  // <- BUG logical error/typo
    std::cout << "Value of PI is " << PI << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

!!! tip
    Add these flag to the compiler `-Wall` and `-Wextra` in order to catch these kind of errors.

### (2) Printf debugging

Print some values at a particular point of source code to discover the current state of the program

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <stdlib.h>

int square(int a){
    return a; // <- BUG logical
}

int main(){
    while(1){
        std::cout << "dbg out 1: " << square(5) << std::endl;
        if(square(5)==25) {
            std::cout << "dbg out 2: " << square(5) << std::endl;
	    exit(1);
        }
        std::cout << "dbg out 3: " << square(5) << std::endl;
    }
    std::cout << "Exiting program\n";
    return 0;
}
```

!!! tip
    Be aware that on embedded systems adding a lot of printf can affect performance and behavior.

### (3) Delta debugging

Don't analyze everything but isolate and check in a kind of way as binary search.

!!! tip
    Verify which functions and code sections are running before analyze code, have a look (and knownledge) of the call stack.
