# Tips for Junior Developers

Being a young developer working in a team can be quite challenging and sometimes a lot of the pressure is put not only on tech related topics but also on social relationship.

Find a good work-life balance. Don't forget to play outside, practice sports.  
In some ways it's more like competing in a long-distance race, sometimes it's ok tu run sprints, but keep steady and balanced for most of the time.

## How to survive

### Focus ###

Context switching comes at the cost of low developer productivity, reduced focus time, and high cognitive residue, all impacting the code quality and final product delivery.
Few suggestions:

+ Disable phone and chat notifications
+ Set specific time-block only for coding or design
+ Plan your daily tasks
+ Less coffee, more sleep

### IDE and Tools ###

Learn how to use them, their workflow, and the most used key shortcuts.

### Do not repeat yourselif (DRY) ###

Learn a scripting language (Python, BASH ...) and make all repetive task executables via single command.
Be reasonable about the time spent coding the scripts. 

### Feedbacks ###

Ask for feedbacks! Receive them a lot, they will help you to be a better developer (and also give them).

### Communication ###

When talking or writing notes be simple, clear and effective (i.e. what to modify, where to apply these changes/impacts, why matters). 

### Ask questions ###

There are no stupid questions, ask about anything that is unclear to you, and write down notes. Don't be shy.  
Before start any task set a timeout for it (half-day, 2 days, ... whatever seems reasonable). If the timeout expires without getting a result then ask for help.

## Before start ##

At beginning of a new planned activity/release a lot of information are exchanged between stackholders. These *kick-off* meetings build the foundation of your next coding weeks, pay attention to the big picture (scope) but also to details.

Check that you have everything you need:

+ Input documentation, task scheduling, sw architecture, coding rules/style.
+ Information about third-party sw libraries, API, communication protocols ...
+ Grants to access online resources like databases, sharepoints, email accounts, ticketing services ...
+ Development tools, IDE, virtual machines, sw simulators. Check also their sw license.
+ Access to sw repositories (starting version of the sourcecode).
+ Have a **clear idea of the final goal** desired by stackholders/managers.
+ Have a schedule of delivery plan (when-what).

As you are working in a team, one nice thing is to plan your holiday months ahead, maybe away from delivery dates or stressful periods, be cool with your team-mates.

## Basic principles

+ Honor deadlines and inform your team leader if there is the possibilty of delays (do not warn the day before, but almost a week before so managers can re-plan activities)
+ Test any code change, even a simple one, on every possible scenario (not only the worst one). Check using simulators, test benches, any usefull tool available (and known their limitations).
+ Share information, issues and update progress status
+ Backup your data, code, doc, test enviroinment (better if on daily basis)

## Work Environment

Top five reason that make developers unhappy of their job:

1. Being stuck in problem solving
2. Time pressure
3. Bad code quality and coding practice
4. Under-performing colleague
5. Feeling inadegate with work

Don't be unhappy, find a way to cope with these things. Ask to your mentor for tips!

Be aware about the [impostor syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome).
