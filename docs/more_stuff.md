Down below are listed further concepts, articles, projects, topics ... that I can't relate directly to the topics of this site. This page is a kind of a *storage box*, sorry for the mess.

## SMART

This method allows you to write goals that are clear, attainable and meaningful.  
Having clarity in your goal-setting provides the motivation and focus you need to be successful.

+ **S**pecific (simple, sensible, significant)
+ **M**easurable (meaningful, motivating)
+ **A**chievable (agreed, attainable)
+ **R**elevant (reasonable, realistic and resourced, results-based)
+ **T**ime bound (time-based, time limited, time/cost limited, timely, time-sensitive)

## The Google Project Aristotle

The researchers found ([read](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html)) that what really mattered was less about who is on the team, and more about how the team worked together. In order of importance:

**Psychological safety** ([video](https://youtu.be/LhoLuui9gX8))  
Team members feel safe to take risks and be vulnerable in front of each other  
*“If I make a mistake on our team, it is not held against me.”*
	
**Dependability**  
Team members get things done on time and meet Google’s high bar for excellence
*“When my teammates say they’ll do something, they follow through with it.”*

**Structure and clarity**
Team members have clear roles, plans and goals
*“Our team has an effective decision-making process.”*

**Meaning**  
Work is personally important to team members
*“The work I do for our team is meaningful to me.”*

**Impact**  
Team members think their work matters and creates change
*“I understand how our team’s work contributes to the organization's goals.”*

The researchers also discovered which variables were not significantly connected with team effectiveness at Google:

+ Collocation of teammates (sitting together in the same office)
+ Consensus-driven decision making
+ Extroversion of team members
+ Individual performance of team members
+ Workload size
+ Seniority
+ Team size
+ Tenure

It’s important to note though that while these variables did not significantly impact team effectiveness measurements at Google, that doesn’t mean they’re not important elsewhere.
