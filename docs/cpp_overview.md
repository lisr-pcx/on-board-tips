# C++ language

A "small bite" of the language [C++ in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/MNeX4EGtR5Y).

Then it's time to acquire some core concepts and build simple stuff.

I found the websites "ByExample" quite effective for a quick ramp-up because they provide you the classic index of topics to acquire.  
Only a small snippet of code is showed, forcing the reader to actively retrieve the theory behind.

## Learn on books

Introduction to the language:

Bjarne Stroustrup  
**A Tour of C++**  
*Addison Wesley*  

For experienced developer:

Scott Meyers  
**Effective Modern C++**
*O'Reilly*  

Frances Buontempo  
**Learn C++ by Example**  
*Manning*  

Jeff Langr  
**Modern C++ Programming, with Test-Driven Development**  
*The Pragmatic Programmers*  

## Learn via video tutorials

For people with zero or very limited background in programming (pick-up the style you prefer most):

[C++ full course - Saldina Nurak](https://youtu.be/GQp1zzTwrIg)  
[C++ tutorial for beginners - Mike Dane](https://youtu.be/vLnPwxZdW4Y)  
[Modern C++ 20 for beginners - Daniel Gakwaya](https://youtu.be/8jLOx1hD3_o)  

The examples are very basic, with focus on learning, so it's important to wide the perspective and start reading code written by other developers. Start looking for small and simple project, and gradually increase the complexity. These sites are a good starting point:

[Github, Awesome C++ frameworks, libraries, resources ..](https://github.com/fffaraz/awesome-cpp/)  

## Learn by building small projects

If you need some inspiration this repository has a curated list of practical projects that anyone can solve (in any programming language):  
[Github - Karan Project List](https://github.com/karan/Projects)

## Focus on ..

- TODO Pointers and memory management
- [Constants](./cpp_constants.md)
- TODO Data structures and STL
- TODO Lamba Expressions
