# C++ language

A "small bite" of the language [C++ in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/MNeX4EGtR5Y).

Then it's time to acquire some core concepts and build simple stuff.

I found the websites "ByExample" quite effective for a quick ramp-up because they provide you the classic index of topics to acquire.  
Only a small snippet of code is showed, forcing the reader to actively retrieve the theory behind.

## Learn on books

TODO

## Learn via video tutorials

TODO

## Learn building small projects

"Learn by doing" is good philosophy, anyway make sure to know some basic concepts or it could became a mere "copy and paste" routine.

## Focus on ..

- Pointers and memory management
- [Constants](./cpp_constants.md)
- Data structures and STL
- Lamba Expressions
